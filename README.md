A

This game is deterministic and played with perfect information. So the AI can maximize the outcome solely based on it's action because it can choose the best action to take being fully informed about the state of the game and the state after taking the action.

It is assumed that this is a Zero-Sum Game as one agent tries to maximize the outcome and the other tries to minimize, although this is not perfectly true as the computer puts tiles randomly and not at the "worst" location for the player. The minimax alogrithm will be applied.
